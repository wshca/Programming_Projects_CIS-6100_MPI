This program is for the Assignment 1 on the programming course CIS*6100.
This is the first part of this assignment. 
Please modify the path in the Makefile to your Pilot installation folder.
To compile it the user have to use the 
make palin

Then the executable is generated.

I tested the program myself and compared all the output files with the supplied ones. I could not find any difference between the generated and given one.
If necessary I can supply the new and old files - stored in my work folder.

The environment I used for the run was mako.sharcnet.ca
I wanted to use this to make sure the user who uses this program can run the program by himself without any libraries installed except those installed in a sharcnet cluster.
