This program is for the Assignment 1 on the programming course CIS*6100.
This is the second part of this assignment. 
Please modify the path in the Makefile to your Pilot installation folder.
To compile it the user have to use the 
make gameoflife

Then the executable is generated.

The environment I used for the run was mako.sharcnet.ca
I wanted to use this to make sure the user who uses this program can run the program by himself without any libraries installed except those installed in a sharcnet cluster.

I furthermore modified the program slightly and let it run. For further analysis I refer to the more detailed documentation of this in the file gameoflife.pdf.
